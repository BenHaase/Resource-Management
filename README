To run:
	type "make"
	type "./oss"

To cleanup:
	type "make clean"

Statistics about execution stored in file called "osstest", and also printed to the screen.
The program uses the bankers algorithm to determine if the filling a processes request
will result in a safe or unsafe state, and allocates accordingly.
Each oss iteration the clock is progressed 500ms + random # 0-500ms, and if there are less
than 18 processes running, spawns a new process.
Child processes have a random termination after their initial request is filled and have a
50-50 chance to terminate or request additional resources and wait after they have run for
a certain amount of time.
Throughput is the number of process that ran to completion.
Turn around time is calculated by (time process terminated - time process entered the system)
Wait time is how long a process spent waiting for requests.
Utilization is (turn around time - wait time)/(throughput)
